<P>These pages are copyrighted by me,
Rupert Brooks. To the best of my knowlege, I am one of the first to come up with
this book idea, and get all the page flipping working, so I take some pride in it.&nbsp; I'd give you instructions
on how to do it, but I'm wayyyy too busy. I encourage you to reverse engineer
it though (Hey, its how I learned to program). To make that easier here
is the <A HREF="book.zip">whole thing zipped up</A>. Just give me credit,
and link back to my page if you use my idea.&nbsp; 'Nuff said.

<P>If you're too cool (busy, tired,
rushed, lazy) to design your own book.&nbsp; I'd be happy to design one
for you.&nbsp; Some exchange of funds would be involved.</TD>
