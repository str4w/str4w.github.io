<I>To move a side, click on one non central square and drag to another
square on the same side. This will rotate the section defined by those
two squares in the direction you dragged. Where you let up on the mouse
button determines the piece to rotate and its direction. Therefore, you
have to release the mouse button while still within the piece you wish
to rotate.To move the whole cube around, grab the middle square on any
side and drag.</I>

<I>Javacube</I>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

I wrote the JavaCube in March of 1996.
It was my first and only large Java project, although I found that I like Java.
It was written in about 25 hours, late at night while wired on real Java.
As you can imagine, it has some flaws.

<P>However, it does work. It works on the BFFI model (Brute Force and Freaking
Ignorance) which makes it a bit slow. It is actually keeping track of the
26 different visible pieces inside the Rubiks Cube. So far, it is not able
to save its position which really limits the fun you could have with it
here. I may add this ability, but its not at the top of my list right now.

<P>Well, when I first wrote this, I couldn't find anything like it, anywhere.&nbsp;
Now, Rubiks cubes have sprung up like toadstools on the web, and I've been far outclassed.  Still, it was a good exercise.&nbsp; Probably the best Rubiks cube
applet site is <A HREF="http://Byrden.com/puzzles/" TARGET="NEW">Twisty Puzzles, by David Byrden</A>. It rules.
