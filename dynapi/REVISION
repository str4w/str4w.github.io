Version 2.5.6
-------------
Notice that we are now using 2.5.6 syntax instead of 2.56. Actually it is the same, but as there's a major
change expected with 2.6 and we will have both branches active during quite a lot of time, it is quite possible that
we reach 2.5.10 and more.

[+] tests/ directori contains sample cases of recently fixed bugs
[-] Fixed zIndex bug in NS4
[-] Fixed layers receiving more than one precreate event
[-] Fixed dragEvent across frames.
[-] Fixed ( finally ) secondary inheritance. You can now safely make widgets inherit from other widgets.

    file before the other DynAPI files
[*] More accurate document size calculations when document is inside a frame
[-] Fixed image animation bug


Version 2.55
------------
[+] Html can now be passed as the 9th parameter of the DynLayer's constructor

[*] Old IE5.5 event fix, which used a javascript:null as background image for empty layers, had to be
    changed into using a real transparent gif which is supplied with the standard distribution, due
    to that javascript:null image causing a warning when using DynAPI via a secure server (https://)
[-] Fixed keyevent code disabling forms inside DynLayer in NS 4.x

Version 2.54

to see how they are included.  Also, keyevents has been moved

noticable is a new layer creation system, as well as

There is a new loadPanel widget for loading external 
files as well as list, path animation (slide), button, 
scrollpanel, and label widgets.  This release also 
features the first API documentation for the 
distribution.  Please post and bugs to the mailing
